	Software Interrupts: SWI are kind of System calls in ARM which help with I/O operations using plugin in ARMSim
	Syntax for SWI:	SWI <OP_CODE>;
					e.g. SWI 0x00
	Following are the predefined codes for different SWI in ARMSim:
	|	OP_CODE	|				Description			|		Inputs		|		Outputs		|	EQU(used in samples)	|
	|										BASIC SWI OPERATIONS FOR I/O in ARMSim										|
	|	0x00	| Display Character to STDOUT		| R0: The Character	| Char on STDOUT	|		SWI_PrChr			|
	|	0x02	| Display String to STDOUT			| R0: address of 	|					|							|
	|			|									| NULL terminated	| String on STDOUT	|		SWI_PrStr			|
	|			|									| ASCII string		|					|							|
	|	0x11	| Halt Execution					|					|					|		SWI_Exit			|
	|	0x12	| Allocate block of memory on heap	| R0: size in Bytes	| R0: Addr of block	|		SWI_MeAlloc			|
	|	0x13	| Deallocate all heap blocks		|					|					|		SWI_DAlloc			|
	|	0x66	|

Assignment 1 - Part 1 - File handling using ARM ISA
Deadline : 24 Jan 2018
	1.	Write an ARM assembly program to WRITE to a file. Write 2 or more lines of text to this file. Make 
		sure you close the file after you write to it.
	2.	Write an ARM assembly program to read from the file that you created in Problem 1.
		Open this file in READ mode, READ and dump its contents to STDOUT.
	3.	Write an ARM assembly program to receive 3 different Integer inputs from STDIN. After receiving all 
		the three values print them on STDOUT.
