	RISC : Reduced Instruction Set Computation
	CISC : Complete Instruction Set Computation
	About ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)

	ARMSIM:
		The ARMSim# is an aid for learning the operation of the ARM architecture. It does not implement every
		feature that can be found on the ARM. Some of the more important LIMITATIONS are listed below.
		1. The ARM architecture supports both little‐endian and big‐endian access to memory. The ARM‐
			Sim# supports only the little‐endian format (the same as the Intel architecture which hosts the ARMSim#).
		2. The ARM architecture has a special mode of execution called ‘Thumb mode’ which is intended
			for embedded system applications where memory is a scarce resource. Each thumb instruction
			occupies only 2 bytes. Thumb mode is not currently supported by ARMSim#.
