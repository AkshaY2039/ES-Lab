Assignment 1 - Part 2 - Timer
Deadline : 31 Jan 2018
	4.	In some single threaded embedded system applications, we use timers built using assembler sub-routine.
		This type of routines is sufficient and reasonably accurate for many applications. Develop a 
		sub-routine “Stimer” that can create 1000(approximately)Clock cycles delay. Using this subroutine 
		write another sub-routine “Ltimer” that can create delay which are multiples of 10000 (approximately) 
		cycles. The Ltimer is simple and no need to other timers.The Ltimer can be used to create periodic scan of I/O devices or any periodic activity.
	Extra.	Using LogiSim Build a Counter for SAP extending which to a ARM like Program Counter.
